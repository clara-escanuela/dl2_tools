This package conains and wraps tools to produce dl3 data from dl2 data as produced by ctapipe.

Its main functionalities include:

- Calculate and apply g/h cuts
- Calculate cuts on essentially all other variables
- Calculate and plot irfs

This can be done out of the box both with point-like and diffuse gamma ray simulations.
